          I'm a full-stack sorcerer fluent in MERN spells, Docker incantations,
          and DevOps rituals. Whether it's building intelligent bots with Rasa
          or wrangling databases with Prisma, I know how to speak the language
          of both humans and machines (although machines tend to listen more).
          I've deployed LLM-powered apps, automated boring stuff with RPA, and
          trained models that could probably beat me in chess—thankfully, they
          can't go on treks.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not debugging the universe, I like hitting the mountains for
          a good trek, challenging friends to a game of chess (where I still
          lose occasionally and blame latency), or getting emotionally attached
          to cricket matches. The harmonium is my analog escape—an instrument
          that doesn’t crash unless *I* do.
        </p>

        <p>
          So whether it's shipping scalable software or figuring out the next
          chord progression on my harmonium, I love solving problems creatively.
          If you’re into clean code, mountain air, or conversations about why
          white pawns never get a promotion, we’ll get along just fine.
